## 🌿 Branches

### Main Branch

The `main` branch contains the core functionality of the application, including:

- Displaying employee data in an AG Grid table.
- Adding new employees.
- Editing existing employees.
- Deleting employees.
- Managing employee skills.
- Client-side data management.

### Server-Side Branch

The `server-side` branch extends the functionality of the `main` branch to include server-side data management, including:

- Server-side pagination.
- Integration with a fake backend server for data fetching and updates.
- Server-side row model with master-detail table.

## 🚀 Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## 🛠️ Building

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
